# Classifying-Flowers

The model above uses Tensorflow & Keras to classify images of flowers which is then used to build out and application for iOS using XCode. I've used the following dataset to build this model:

The data above is split into a training and test set to be used for the prediction model.

A Labels text file is also included which are imported into XCode for the tensorflow application.
